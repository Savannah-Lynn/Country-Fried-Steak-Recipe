<h4 style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Ingrediants:</h4>

<ul  style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">
<p style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Country Fried Steak:</p>
<li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
<li>2 large eggs</li>
<li>2 cups all-purpos flour</li>
<li>2 teaspoons seasoned salt</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>3/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
<li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
<li>3 pounds cuber steak; tenderized round steak that's been extra tenderized</li>
<li>Kosher salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup canola or vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
</ul>

<ul style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">
<p style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Gravy:</p>
<li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
<li>3 to 4 cups whole milk</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
<li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>Mashed potatoes, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">How to Make:</h4>
<ol style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">For the steak: Begin with setting up an assembly line of dishes.  Mix the milk with the eggs
in one; the flour mixed with the seasoned salt, 1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper, paprika and cayenne in another; and the meat in a third.  
Then have a clean plate at the end to recieve the breaded meat.</li>
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Work with one peice of meat at a time.  Sprinkle both sides with kosher salt and black
pepper, then place it in the flour mixture.  Turn to coat.  Place the meat into the milk/egg mixture, turning to coat.  Finally, place it
back in the flour and turn to coat(dry mixture/wet mixture/dry mixture/wet mixture).  Place the breaded meat on the clean plate, then repeat
 with remaining meat.</li>
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Add the butter.  Drop in a few sprinkles 
of flour to make sure it is sufficiantly hot.  When the butter sizzles immediatly, you know it is ready.  (It should not brown right away, 
if it does, the fire is too hot.)  ook the meat, 3 peices at a time, until the edges start to look golden brown, about 2 minutes each side.  
Remove the meat to a paper towel-lined plate and keep them warm by covering lightly with another plate or a sheet of foil.  Repeat until after
all the meat is cooked.</li>
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">After all the meat is fried, pour off the grease into a heat proof bowl.  Without cleaning the 
skillet, return it to the stove over medium-low heat.  Add 1/4 cup of the grease back to the skillet and allow it to heat up.</li>
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">For the gravy: When the grease is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over the grease.  
Using a whisk, mix the flour eiht the grease, creating a golden-brown paste.  Add more flour if it looks overly greasy; add a little
more grease if it becomes too pasty/clumpy.  Keep cooking until the roux reaches a deep golden brown color.</li>
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Pour in the milk, whisking constantly.  Add the seasoned salt and black pepper to taste and cook, 
whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick, 5-10 minutes.  Be prepared to add more milk if it becomes overly thick.  Be sure to taste to make 
sure gravy is sufficiantly seasoned.</li>
<li style="color: #FCECC9; font-family: georgia;">Serve the meat next to a big side of mashed potatoes.  Pour gravy over the whole shebang!</li>
